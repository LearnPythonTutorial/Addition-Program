# Addition-Program
Addition Program in Python
In this tutorial, we are about build a very simple addition program in Python. We will show how to build a simple program that will add two integer numbers that a user gives us via the terminal or command prompt and then we will return the sum of those two numbers to the user. The program will be accessible to download at the end of the tutorial. Just try to follow along the more you practice writing programs in Python the more you will learn.
